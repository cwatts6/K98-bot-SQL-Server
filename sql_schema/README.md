# SQL Schema Export

This folder is **generated automatically** by:

- `C:\Scripts\Export-SqlSchemaAndPush.ps1`
- Nightly via Windows Task Scheduler

Contents:
- One file per object: `Schema.Name.Type.sql`
- Tables, views, stored procedures, and user-defined functions

Do not edit these files by hand. Make changes in SQL Server, then let the export script regenerate and commit them.
