# SQL Migrations

This folder is the deployable source for intentional SQL changes.

Schema snapshots in `sql_schema/` are generated reference material. Do not deploy from
snapshots directly unless an approved emergency recovery plan requires it.

## Naming

Use sortable migration names:

```text
YYYYMMDD_NNN_short_description.sql
```

Example:

```text
20260602_001_add_schema_migration_history.sql
```

Rules:

- Date is the migration creation date.
- `NNN` increments per day.
- Description uses lowercase snake case.
- The migration ID is the filename without `.sql`.
- Never rename a migration after it has been merged.

## Header

Every migration must start with this metadata block:

```sql
/*
MigrationId: 20260602_001_add_schema_migration_history
Purpose: Add SQL migration tracking table
Author: cwatts
CreatedUtc: 2026-06-02
RequiresBackup: Yes
RiskLevel: Low
Rollback: Manual
TransactionMode: Auto
RelatedBotPR:

*/
```

## Rollback

Rollback is explicit, not assumed.

- `Included`: a matching script exists in `migrations/rollback/`.
- `Manual`: rollback notes are in the migration or release notes.
- `NotPossible`: recovery requires restore, forward fix, or bespoke manual recovery.

The deploy runner prevents repeat execution through `dbo.SchemaMigrationHistory`; individual
migrations should still be idempotent where that is genuinely safe.
